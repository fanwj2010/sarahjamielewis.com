# Why Privacy is Important (to me)
<br/>
*tl;dr* **Privacy is Safety, Privacy is Security, Privacy is Strength**
<br/><br/>

I have many secrets. Most people do. 

Many people don't even realize the number of secrets they have too.

Bank account credentials, social media passwords, house keys. 

All of them are secrets, to some degree.

Let's not forgot our passwords to our corporate accounts, our VPNs, our private encryption keys.

Very rarely do people post their blood test results online for the entire world to see. 

Why do we hold all this information back? *Safety and Security.*

We hold all this back because of the unknown.

However, we cannot hold all of our secrets alone. 

We call this maintenance Trust; And it is often accepted willingly. 

Being human we have an urge to share our secrets, to share the burden, to be free.

Trust is very important, but also very fragile. 

One mistake, a malicious party and the whole structure falls, goodbye.

When trust is broken, the safety and security of the secret is also compromised

And that often means the safety and security of the subject of that secret is compromised.

**When you break trust, when you destroy privacy, you harm people.**

The civil liberties we take for granted today exist because privacy was possible.

And because those that were entrusted with that privacy respected it, they were unstoppable.

In an age where so much is open-as-default we should be scared.

The future doesn't have to be scary, as long as we guard what is shared

We can encrypt our communications. We can decentralize our systems and distribute control. 

We can inform others of their vulnerabilities and, together, stronger we will grow.

That is why privacy is so important to me. It is important because it is an enabler and a protector. 

It is one of the best tools we have against tyranny and fascism. It is a weapon and a defender.

There is little more that I can do, to help you see, how important privacy is to me.

So if you should disagree, and believe that all information should be free.

Or that privacy is a danger to a free society.

Then I have just one thing to say, and I will say it publicly, since I am free to choose.

History is written by those that win. And I don't intend to lose.
