# Why I Am Vegan

At the start of 2015 I made a major life decision and adopted a vegan lifestyle - 
cutting out meat, dairy, eggs and animal byproducts from my food, clothing and home.

## Why did I become vegan?

Back in 2013 my partner and I adopted a gorgeous little bunny whom we named
Juniper. Juniper is the first animal I have had the privilege of knowing and watching her grow up changed how
I look at animals. 

I watched Juniper learn how to solve puzzles to get around 
obstacles we had set up (to prevent her from finding her way to the back of our
sofa, for example).

As well as puzzle solving, I also noticed her emotions and the impact that
we had on her life - her excitement when given treats, her developed sense
of time (for food, for sleep) and her fear and sadness when something or someone
scared her - or she hurt herself.

This new outlook came to a head when someone asked me - "Would you eat a rabbit now?"
 to which I had to answer, no, I couldn't - I couldn't bring myself to kill and
 and eat something that I've seen is sentient, smart and caring.
 
As you may expect, the next logical leap is an easy one - If I feel that way 
about rabbits - then why not cows or sheep or pigs or chickens? And, the result
was clear - If I was to be morally and ethically consistent, I couldn't continue
in a lifestyle that harmed and killed the very animals that I had come to
respect.

Some documentaries on egg and dairy production hammered the nail in the coffin 
for all animal products and by-products - and I became vegan.
 
## What Happened Next?

Not much. For the first few months I simply switched out animal products for
the fake meat versions - so overall my eating habits didn't change much. I switched
out cow milk for almond and soy milk in my coffee. I didn't miss "real" meat, 
or eggs, or milk - it was all fairly boring.

## Reactions and Observations

It is amazing how similar the talking points are in the LGBT community and the
vegan community. People in both circles talk about "coming out", rejection,
humilation, retaliation etc. And there can be no doubt that there is still
a social stigma around veganism - although it is getting better.

Even over the last year I have noticed a remarkable increase in the number of
vegan products on store shelves. Stores which only carried 1 or 2 items back in
January now have entire sections dedicated to meat replacements.

Like all vegans, I have encountered the same few responses:

* "Oh I could never give up bacon/cheese!"
* "Oh I'd love to do that, but I can't for [not a real reason]"
* "I'm designed to eat meat"

Every.Single.Time.

## Health Impact

I have never been a particularly healthy individual - I have been overweight or
obese for most of my adult life. Removing all animal products and replacing them
with vegan alternatives didn't improve my healthy eating situation - but it
did have a profound impact on my health.

I lost 40lbs (10kg) between January and April 2015. This is most likely because
of a number of different factors, namely:

* I eat out many days because of work - vegan alternatives tend to be lower
calorie options.
* At home, vegan alternatives are also lower calorie and higher in fiber so
I ended up feeling full on less food.

As May and June started to come into the picture - I started to rethink some
of my vegan junk food choices. I ditched the meat alternatives and instead
opted for beans, legumes and tofu as protein sources - building curries,
chilis and other weekly bulk cooking around these things.

By November 2015 I had lost another 40lbs bringing my total weight down 80lbs
over all.

I feel slightly uneasy publicizing the health benefits of my transition to 
Veganism as the truth is I didn't do it for my health - I did it for the 
animals - the health benefits have just been another huge upside.

Going vegan has also led me to re-examine my other choices - the sources of my
coffee and clothes, the corporations I am willing to support, the charities I
donate too and much more.

## Why are you writing this?

Though arbitrary, the new year is a good time to reflect and begin to look 
forward. I want to encourage everyone who reads this today, and in the future
to reexamine your life choices and ask yourself whether you believe the systematic
abuse of animals for pleasure is a legacy that you want to continue.

Even by conservative estimates, as a species we kill over 100,000,000 animals
every single *day*. All of those animals are sentient creatures. They may not
be able to communicate with us like other humans - but they do feel, and they
do suffer.

I can talk about the environmental benefits, the personal and societal health
benefits - but the truth is, none of that should matter; It should be unacceptable
in a humane society to treat other species the way we currently do, to enslave,
forcibly impregnate, mutilate and eventually kill - all so we can enjoy a 
moment of pleasure.
